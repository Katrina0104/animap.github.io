        <!--  European Bison -->
        <h2>5. European Bison</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Bison bonasus</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/european bison.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>European Bison</b>, also known as the wisent, is a massive herbivore that once roamed the woodlands and grasslands of Europe in great numbers. Today, due to habitat loss and overhunting, their populations have drastically dwindled, and the European Bison became nearly extinct in the wild. However, thanks to successful conservation efforts, these majestic creatures are now making a comeback. Standing up to 6 feet tall and weighing as much as 2,000 pounds, the European Bison is the largest land mammal in Europe. With its shaggy coat and large horns, it has a commanding presence, and its sheer size makes it a symbol of the wild, untamed wilderness of Europe’s forests.</p>

        <p>European Bison are social animals that live in herds, with the females and young forming one group and the males usually living alone or in small bachelor herds. They are primarily grazers and feed on grasses, shrubs, and tree leaves. Their feeding habits play an important role in the ecosystem, as they help maintain the health of the forest by preventing overgrowth of vegetation. These bison are also known for their strength and endurance, able to travel long distances in search of food. In the wild, European Bison are gentle giants, and although they can be dangerous if threatened, they generally avoid conflicts with other animals and humans. As part of a global effort to protect these animals, there are now several rewilding projects in place to restore their natural habitats and ensure their survival for future generations.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> European Bison are expert tree-shakers! They sometimes push over young trees and shrubs to graze, which helps clear spaces in the forest for other plants and animals to thrive.</p>

        <!-- Black-tailed Godwit -->
        <h2>6. Black-tailed Godwit </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Limosa limosa</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/black-tailed godwit.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Black-tailed Godwit</b> is a striking shorebird with long, slender legs and a distinctive black-and-white striped tail, native to Europe and parts of Asia. This migratory bird is most commonly found in wetlands, estuaries, and mudflats, where it feeds on invertebrates, small fish, and plants by probing its long, curved beak into the mud. Known for its elegant flight and distinctive call, the Black-tailed Godwit is a skilled forager, using its sharp bill to sift through the muddy waters in search of food. Its migratory nature makes it a fascinating species to observe, as it travels from its breeding grounds in northern Europe to its wintering grounds in Africa and southern Asia.</p>

        <p>The breeding season of the Black-tailed Godwit is a special time, as these birds form large colonies in the wetlands, where they build nests in the long grasses. They lay their eggs in shallow depressions in the mud and are extremely protective of their young. Though not considered critically endangered, the Black-tailed Godwit faces threats from habitat destruction, particularly wetland drainage, and pollution. Conservation efforts focus on protecting wetland habitats, which are essential for these birds during both breeding and migration.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> During migration, Black-tailed Godwits travel thousands of kilometers! Some populations migrate all the way from northern Europe to West Africa, crossing vast distances.</p>

        <!-- Corncrake -->
        <h2>7. Corncrake </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Crex crex</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/corncrake.JPG" >
        <p>The <b>Corncrake</b> is a secretive and elusive bird that is often heard before it is seen. With its brownish plumage and short tail, the Corncrake blends seamlessly into the tall grasses and vegetation of meadows, grasslands, and farmlands. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, the Corncrake was once a common sight across these regions, but its numbers have sharply declined due to habitat destruction, particularly the loss of traditional farming practices. It is known for its distinctive “crex-crex” call, which is most often heard at night or in the early morning. This call is so loud and distinctive that it is easy to locate, even though the bird itself is difficult to spot.</p>

        <p>Corncrakes are ground dwellers, spending most of their time hidden in tall an expert at staying hidden. When threatened, it will often freeze or crouch down in the grass rather than fly away. This behavior has contributed to its decline, as the mowing of fields and agricultural changes often destroy their nests before the young birds can fledge.</p>

        <p>The Corncrake's population has significantly declined over the past century, largely due to the intensification of agriculture and the disappearance of traditional farming methods. Conservation efforts are now focused on restoring suitable habitats, such as wet me carry over long distances, making them easy to hear but hard to spot.</p>
