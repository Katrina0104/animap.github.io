        <!--  Egyptian Vulture -->
        <h2>8. Egyptian Vulture</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy"> Neophron percnopterus</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/egyptian vulture.jpeg" >
        <p>The <b>Egyptian Vulture</b> is a fascinating bird of prey known for its unique appearance and important ecological role as a scavenger. With its white feathers, yellow face, and distinctively long, curved beak, this vulture stands out in the skies of Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia. Unlike many other vultures, the Egyptian Vulture is smaller and often considered one of the most intelligent among vultures. It is known to use tools, such as picking up rocks to break open the eggs of larger birds, a remarkable skill not often seen in the animal kingdom. This vulture primarily feeds on carrion, but it also enjoys a diet of eggs, small animals, and even garbage, making it a vital part of the ecosystem by helping to clean up carcasses and maintain a healthy environment.</p>

        <p>Egyptian Vultures migrate across vast distances, traveling from their breeding grounds in southern Europe and Central Asia to Africa during the winter months. They are solitary or found in small groups, and their keen eyesight helps them locate food from great distances. However, they are facing several threats, including habitat loss, poisoning, and human persecution. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting nesting sites, reducing poisoning incidents, and ensuring safe migratory routes.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Egyptian Vulture is often referred to as a "tool user" because it has been observed using rocks to break open the eggs of larger birdsâ€”just like some primates!</p>

        <!-- Goitered Gazelle -->
        <h2>9. Goitered Gazelle</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Gazella subgutturosa</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/goitered gazelle.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Goitered Gazelle</b>, also known as the Black-tailed Gazelle, is a graceful and agile animal native to the arid regions of Central Asia. Known for its slender body, sharp horns, and distinctive goiter (a swelling in its throat), this gazelle is a true survivor in harsh desert landscapes. Its goiter, a unique adaptation, helps the gazelle regulate its temperature and conserve water, which is essential in its dry, hot habitat. The Goitered Gazelle is often found in open grasslands, semi-deserts, and rocky slopes, where it can use its speed and agility to escape predators like wolves and jackals. These gazelles are herd animals, often found in small groups, and they rely on their keen sense of hearing and sight to detect danger from afar.</p>

        <p>Despite their ability to thrive in challenging environments, Goitered Gazelles face significant threats due to hunting, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Their population has dramatically decreased in some areas, and conservation efforts are focused on habitat restoration, protection from poaching, and increasing awareness of their role in the ecosystem.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Goitered Gazelles have a unique "goiter" under their throat, which helps them survive in dry, hot climates by conserving water and regulating their body temperature!</p>

        <!-- European Roller -->
        <h2>10. European Roller </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Coracias garrulus</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/european roller.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>European Roller</b> is a stunningly colorful bird known for its vibrant blue and green plumage and its acrobatic flight displays. This bird is a member of the corvid family and is found across southern Europe, parts of Asia, and North Africa. European Rollers are particularly noticeable during the breeding season when they perform aerial acrobatics, diving and swooping through the air to impress potential mates. They are also known for their "rolling" flight pattern, where they roll their bodies in the air, which is where they get their name. These birds are primarily insectivores, feeding on a diet of beetles, grasshoppers, and other large insects, which they catch in mid-flight or from the ground.</p>

        <p>European Rollers nest in tree cavities, cliffs, or old buildings, and they are highly territorial during the breeding season. Although they were once widespread, their population has declined in many parts of Europe, primarily due to habitat destruction, climate change, and the loss of suitable nesting sites. Conservation efforts aim to preserve their habitats, including creating artificial nest boxes and protecting areas where they can hunt and breed safely.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> European Rollers are known for their acrobatic flight, where they dive and roll in the air, making them one of the most spectacular birds to watch during the breeding season!</p>
