        <h2>1. Altai Weasel </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Mustela altaica</div>
        <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/altai weasel.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Altai Weasel</b> is a small but mighty predator that thrives in the remote, high-altitude areas of Central Asia. Found in the rocky, alpine meadows of the Altai Mountains, this weasel has a sleek, elongated body and a playful, energetic demeanor. It’s well-equipped for life in the cold, harsh environment, with a thick coat that helps it survive the freezing winters. Altai Weasels are active hunters and are known for their speed and agility. Despite their small size, they are skilled at chasing down prey, including rodents, birds, and even insects. Their sharp teeth and claws make them formidable hunters, able to catch their meals with incredible precision.</p>

        <p>During the colder months, Altai Weasels change their fur to a white color, blending perfectly with the snow-covered landscape. This helps them evade predators and sneak up on their prey. These weasels are also solitary by nature, preferring to live alone or in small family groups. They communicate with each other through scent marking and sometimes through vocalizations, which are often high-pitched squeaks or growls. Unlike other weasels, the Altai Weasel is particularly adept at surviving the extreme temperatures of the Altai Mountains, where the winters can be long and harsh.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Altai Weasels are incredibly fast and agile! They can run and jump quickly to catch their prey or escape from predators, and they even hunt in the snow.</p>

        <!-- Apollo Butterfly-->
        <h2>2. Apollo Butterfly </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Parnassius apollo</div>
        <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/apollo butterfly.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Apollo Butterfly</b>, known for its breathtaking beauty, is one of Europe’s most stunning and rare butterflies. With its striking white wings, adorned with black and red spots, the Apollo Butterfly appears almost like a living work of art, fluttering gracefully through the high-altitude meadows of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and parts of Eastern Europe. This butterfly’s striking appearance and delicate flight make it a favorite among nature enthusiasts and photographers. However, it is also one of the most endangered species in Europe. Once widespread, the Apollo Butterfly’s population has dramatically decreased due to habitat loss, climate change, and human interference. Conservation efforts are currently underway to protect its habitats and ensure its survival.</p>

        <p>Adult Apollo Butterflies are not active feeders. They live only for a short time after emerging from their cocoons, focused solely on reproducing. The larvae, on the other hand, feed on a variety of plants, particularly those in the parsley family. These butterflies thrive in mountain meadows where the climate is cooler and flowers are abundant. Sadly, because of human activities like agriculture and urbanization, many of these meadows have disappeared, putting the butterfly’s survival at risk. Nonetheless, the Apollo Butterfly remains a symbol of the delicate balance between humans and nature, and efforts to protect its habitat continue to grow.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Apollo Butterfly’s wings are so beautiful that they are often called "the jewels of the mountains." Their wings shimmer like a pearl in the sunlight!</p>

       <div class="taxonomy">Limosa limosa</div>
       <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/black-tailed godwit.jpg" >
       <p>The <b>Black-tailed Godwit</b> is a striking shorebird with long, slender legs and a distinctive black-and-white striped tail, native to Europe and parts of Asia. This migratory bird is most commonly found in wetlands, estuaries, and mudflats, where it feeds on invertebrates, small fish, and plants by probing its long, curved beak into the mud. Known for its elegant flight and distinctive call, the Black-tailed Godwit is a skilled forager, using its sharp bill to sift through the muddy waters in search of food. Its migratory nature makes it a fascinating species to observe, as it travels from its breeding grounds in northern Europe to its wintering grounds in Africa and southern Asia.</p>

       <p>The breeding season of the Black-tailed Godwit is a special time, as these birds form large colonies in the wetlands, where they build nests in the long grasses. They lay their eggs in shallow depressions in the mud and are extremely protective of their young. Though not considered critically endangered, the Black-tailed Godwit faces threats from habitat destruction, particularly wetland drainage, and pollution. Conservation efforts focus on protecting wetland habitats, which are essential for these birds during both breeding and migration.</p>

       <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> During migration, Black-tailed Godwits travel thousands of kilometers! Some populations migrate all the way from northern Europe to West Africa, crossing vast distances.</p>

       <div class="taxonomy">Crex crex</div>
       <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/corncrake.JPG" >
       <p>The <b>Corncrake</b> is a secretive and elusive bird that is often heard before it is seen. With its brownish plumage and short tail, the Corncrake blends seamlessly into the tall grasses and vegetation of meadows, grasslands, and farmlands. Native to Europe and parts of Asia, the Corncrake was once a common sight across these regions, but its numbers have sharply declined due to habitat destruction, particularly the loss of traditional farming practices. It is known for its distinctive “crex-crex” call, which is most often heard at night or in the early morning. This call is so loud and distinctive that it is easy to locate, even though the bird itself is difficult to spot.</p>

       <p>Corncrakes are ground dwellers, spending most of their time hidden in tall an expert at staying hidden. When threatened, it will often freeze or crouch down in the grass rather than fly away. This behavior has contributed to its decline, as the mowing of fields and agricultural changes often destroy their nests before the young birds can fledge.</p>

       <p>The Corncrake's population has significantly declined over the past century, largely due to the intensification of agriculture and the disappearance of traditional farming methods. Conservation efforts are now focused on restoring suitable habitats, such as wet me carry over long distances, making them easy to hear but hard to spot.</p>
