        <!--  Afghan Tortoise -->
        <h2>1. Afghan Tortoise</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy"> Testudo horsfieldii</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/afghan tortoise.jpeg" >
        <p>The <b>Afghan Tortoise</b>, also known as the Russian Tortoise, is a resilient little reptile native to the rugged landscapes of Central Asia, particularly Afghanistan, parts of Pakistan, and Iran. Known for its calm and patient nature, this tortoise is well-adapted to life in the dry, rocky terrains where food and water can be scarce. With its small, dome-shaped shell that comes in shades of brown and yellow, the Afghan Tortoise is a master of survival. Unlike many other reptiles, it can endure long periods without drinking water by eating plants that provide moisture. In fact, it spends much of its life in burrows or under bushes, where it remains cool during the scorching summer months and warm during the chilly desert nights. The Afghan Tortoise is also known for its slow-moving lifestyle, making it seem almost peaceful, but don’t be fooled! Despite its laid-back demeanor, it has a great ability to escape predators by retreating into its hard shell.</p>

        <p>Although slow and steady on land, the Afghan Tortoise is remarkably agile when it comes to climbing and exploring its rocky surroundings. When in captivity, they are relatively easy to care for as long as their diet and habitat are properly maintained. Their diet includes a variety of grasses, leaves, and flowers, and in return, they provide an important ecological service by helping control plant growth in their native environment.</p>
        
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Afghan Tortoise can go for months without drinking water! It survives on the moisture from the plants it eats, making it a true desert survivor.</p>

        <!-- Altai Weasel -->
        <h2>2. Altai Weasel </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Mustela altaica</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/altai weasel.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Altai Weasel</b> is a small but mighty predator that thrives in the remote, high-altitude areas of Central Asia. Found in the rocky, alpine meadows of the Altai Mountains, this weasel has a sleek, elongated body and a playful, energetic demeanor. It’s well-equipped for life in the cold, harsh environment, with a thick coat that helps it survive the freezing winters. Altai Weasels are active hunters and are known for their speed and agility. Despite their small size, they are skilled at chasing down prey, including rodents, birds, and even insects. Their sharp teeth and claws make them formidable hunters, able to catch their meals with incredible precision.</p>

        <p>During the colder months, Altai Weasels change their fur to a white color, blending perfectly with the snow-covered landscape. This helps them evade predators and sneak up on their prey. These weasels are also solitary by nature, preferring to live alone or in small family groups. They communicate with each other through scent marking and sometimes through vocalizations, which are often high-pitched squeaks or growls. Unlike other weasels, the Altai Weasel is particularly adept at surviving the extreme temperatures of the Altai Mountains, where the winters can be long and harsh.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Altai Weasels are incredibly fast and agile! They can run and jump quickly to catch their prey or escape from predators, and they even hunt in the snow.</p>

        <!-- Apollo Butterfly-->
        <h2>3. Apollo Butterfly </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Parnassius apollo</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/apollo butterfly.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Apollo Butterfly</b>, known for its breathtaking beauty, is one of Europe’s most stunning and rare butterflies. With its striking white wings, adorned with black and red spots, the Apollo Butterfly appears almost like a living work of art, fluttering gracefully through the high-altitude meadows of the Alps, the Pyrenees, and parts of Eastern Europe. This butterfly’s striking appearance and delicate flight make it a favorite among nature enthusiasts and photographers. However, it is also one of the most endangered species in Europe. Once widespread, the Apollo Butterfly’s population has dramatically decreased due to habitat loss, climate change, and human interference. Conservation efforts are currently underway to protect its habitats and ensure its survival.</p>

        <p>Adult Apollo Butterflies are not active feeders. They live only for a short time after emerging from their cocoons, focused solely on reproducing. The larvae, on the other hand, feed on a variety of plants, particularly those in the parsley family. These butterflies thrive in mountain meadows where the climate is cooler and flowers are abundant. Sadly, because of human activities like agriculture and urbanization, many of these meadows have disappeared, putting the butterfly’s survival at risk. Nonetheless, the Apollo Butterfly remains a symbol of the delicate balance between humans and nature, and efforts to protect its habitat continue to grow.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Apollo Butterfly’s wings are so beautiful that they are often called "the jewels of the mountains." Their wings shimmer like a pearl in the sunlight!</p>

        <!-- Desert Monitor-->
        <h2>4. Desert Monitor </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Varanus griseus</div>
        <img src="../kyrghzstan/kyrghzstan animal img/desert monitor.jpeg" >
        <p>The <b>Desert Monitor</b> is a tough and resilient lizard that calls the dry, harsh deserts of the Middle East, North Africa, and parts of India its home. These monitors are impressive creatures, built for survival in the hottest environments on Earth. They are large lizards, with long, muscular bodies and powerful limbs that make them great diggers and climbers. Desert Monitors are skilled hunters and feed on a wide variety of prey, including insects, small mammals, birds, and eggs. Their keen sense of smell helps them track down food, even in the vast, barren landscape of the desert. They are also known to scavenge, making the most of any available food source. Despite their somewhat intimidating appearance, Desert Monitors are not aggressive and tend to avoid human contact when possible.</p>

        <p>During the hot desert days, Desert Monitors seek shelter in burrows or shady areas to escape the blistering heat. They are also excellent swimmers and can dive into pools of water to hunt or cool off. As they are solitary creatures, they spend much of their time alone, except during the mating season. Their life in the desert requires incredible adaptability, and their ability to survive extreme conditions has earned them a reputation as desert survivors. These lizards are often found near water sources, as they need to drink to stay hydrated, but they are well equipped to endure the scarcity of water in their native habitats.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Desert Monitors are fantastic swimmers! They can dive into ponds or rivers to hunt for food, and they even have a special ability to hold their breath underwater for extended periods.</p>
