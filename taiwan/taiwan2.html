        <h2>5.  Taiwan Beauty Snake</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Elaphe taeniura</div>
        <img src="../taiwan/taiwan animal img/taiwan beauty snake.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Taiwan Beauty Snake</b> is a stunning species found only on the island of Taiwan. Recognizable by its striking pattern of bright yellow, black, and white markings, it is considered one of the most beautiful snakes in Asia. Despite its impressive appearance, the Taiwan Beauty Snake is non-venomous and generally shy. It is known for its graceful movements and is primarily arboreal, meaning it spends much of its time in trees. This species is a skilled climber, using its prehensile tail to grasp branches while hunting or resting.</p>

        <p>These snakes primarily feed on small vertebrates, such as rodents, birds, and amphibians. Their diet helps control populations of smaller animals, maintaining a balanced ecosystem in the forests and grasslands of Taiwan. The Taiwan Beauty Snake is an important species in Taiwanese biodiversity, and conservation efforts are underway to ensure its continued survival due to habitat loss and human encroachment. While not aggressive towards humans, the Taiwan Beauty Snake will defend itself if threatened by biting, though its bite is harmless to people.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Taiwan Beauty Snake is often kept in captivity by reptile enthusiasts due to its striking appearance and calm nature. However, because it is a protected species in Taiwan, keeping one in the wild without proper permits is illegal.</p>

        <img src="../taiwan/taiwan animal img/chinese otter.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Chinese Otter</b> is a subspecies of the Eurasian otter, found mainly in China, Taiwan, and other parts of East Asia. These otters are semi-aquatic mammals that thrive in rivers, lakes, and coastal areas. Known for their playful and curious nature, they are often seen swimming, diving, and playing in the water. Chinese Otters have sleek, dark brown fur, webbed feet for swimming, and sharp claws for catching fish and small invertebrates.</p>

        <p>Chinese Otters are highly social creatures and live in family groups or pairs, often seen grooming each other and communicating through a range of vocalizations. They primarily feed on fish, crustaceans, and amphibians, and are skilled hunters, using their sharp claws and quick reflexes to catch prey. While they are not endangered, they face threats from habitat loss, pollution, and hunting. Conservation efforts focus on protecting their habitats and ensuring their populations remain healthy.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Chinese Otters are excellent swimmers, capable of diving to depths of up to 20 meters (66 feet) to hunt for food!</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Prionailurus bengalensis</div>
        <img src="../taiwan/taiwan animal img/leopard cat.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Leopard Cat</b> is a small wild cat found in South and Southeast Asia. These elusive creatures have a striking appearance, with a coat that features rosettes similar to those of larger cats like leopards, hence their name. Leopard Cats are skilled hunters, preying on small mammals, birds, reptiles, and insects. They are solitary animals, often found in dense forests, grasslands, and even near human settlements in some areas.</p>

        <p>Leopard Cats are nocturnal and have excellent camouflage, which helps them stalk their prey under the cover of darkness. They are also known for their agility, capable of climbing trees and swimming with ease. Though they are not classified as endangered, their populations are threatened by habitat loss, hunting for their fur, and conflicts with humans. In some regions, conservation efforts are being made to protect their natural habitats and reduce human-wildlife conflict.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Leopard Cats are known to make a range of vocalizations, including growls, meows, and purring, and are often mistaken for domestic cats due to their size and appearance!</p>
