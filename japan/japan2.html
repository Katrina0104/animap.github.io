        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/tokudaia-osimensis_03_cprt1.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Ryukyu Long-haired Rat</b> is a unique and fascinating rodent that lives only on the Ryukyu Islands of Japan, including Okinawa. This little rat has long, shaggy fur, which makes it stand out from other rats. It grows to about 12 to 17 centimeters (4.7 to 6.7 inches) long, excluding its tail, which can be up to 15 centimeters (5.9 inches). The fur on its back is darker than the rest of its body, giving it a striking appearance. This rat is an excellent climber and can easily move through the trees and bushes in its forest home. It has large, round ears and small eyes, which help it navigate through the dense vegetation at night.</p>
        <p>The <b>Ryukyu Long-haired Rat</b> is nocturnal, meaning it is most active at night. It forages for food like fruits, seeds, and small insects, and it loves to climb trees and hide in the forest. While the Ryukyu Long-haired Rat is not considered endangered, it faces challenges such as habitat loss and the arrival of non-native predators, like cats and snakes. Conservationists are working to protect its home by conserving forests and educating people about the importance of keeping invasive species out.</p>
        
        <p> <b>Fun Fact:</b>  Despite its long, shaggy fur, the Ryukyu Long-haired Rat is so fast and nimble that it can quickly climb trees and leap from branch to branch!</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Rana porosa porosa</div>
        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/japanaese brown frog.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Japanese Brown Frog</b>, also known as the Amur Brn Frog, is a wonderful amphibian found in Japan and other parts of East Asia. It has bumpy, rough skin that helps it blend in with its surroundings, making it hard to spot in the wild. These frogs are medium-sized, growing to about 5 to 9 centimeters (2 to 3.5 inches) in length, and they come in shades of brown, olive, and gray, perfect for hiding among rocks, leaves, and mud. They live near ponds, lakes, and swamps, where they hunt for food like insects, worms, and small snails.</p>
        <p>The <b>Japanese Brown Frog</b> are most active during the warmer months, from spring to early autumn. When it’s time to mate, males make a distinctive "kurr-kurr" sound to attract females. This chorus of calls can be heard for miles around! The frogs lay their eggs in water, and after hatching, the tadpoles slowly grow into adult frogs. While the species isn’t endangered, it still faces threats from pollution and habitat loss. It’s important to keep their wetland homes safe to make sure they continue to thrive!</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Male Japanese Brown Frogs have a special "kurr-kurr" call that helps them find a mate. It’s like their very own frog music concert!</p>

        <!-- Japanese Crested Ibis  -->
        <h2>6. Japanese Crested Ibis  </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Nipponia nippon</div>
        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/japanese crested ibis.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Japanese Crested Ibis</b>, known as the <b>"Toki"</b>  in Japan, is a stunning bird with a touch of elegance. Its snow-white feathers glow with a soft pink tint under the sunlight, and a striking reddish-brown crest gives this bird its royal name. Adding to its beauty are its long, thin legs and a curved beak that looks like it was made for finding hidden treasures in shallow waters. These birds grow about 75 to 80 centimeters long (30 to 32 inches) and can weigh between 2.3 and 2.9 kilograms (5.1 to 6.4 pounds)—impressive, right?</p>
        <p>Once upon a time, <b>Japanese Crested Ibis</b> flew across East Asia, from Japan to China, Korea, and even Russia. But now, they’re mostly found in Japan because of challenges like habitat loss and hunting. Their favorite places to hang out are wetlands, rivers, and marshes where they can snack on tasty treats like crustaceans, insects, fish, and even frogs. They’re picky eaters, using their long beaks to search through mud and water for the best bites.</p>
        <p>When spring arrives, these elegant birds become even busier—it’s nesting season! Pairs of ibises team up to build cozy nests in trees, close to water. The female lays two to four eggs, and both parents take turns keeping them warm. After about a month, fluffy chicks hatch, ready to learn the ways of the world. The little ones are watched over by their parents until they’re strong enough to fly off on their own, usually after 40 to 45 days.</p>
        <p>Despite their beauty, these birds faced tough times. By the mid-1900s, the Japanese Crested Ibis nearly vanished! Thankfully, people rallied to save them, launching breeding programs and restoring their habitats. Today, though still critically endangered, their numbers are slowly rising—a hopeful story for an iconic bird.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Japanese Crested Ibis is not just a bird; it’s a cultural treasure in Japan! The word "Toki" is often used in songs, poems, and art to symbolize beauty and nature.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Scolopax mira</div>
        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/amami woodcock.jpg" >
        <p>Meet the<b> Amami Woodcock</b>, a master of camouflage and a bird that’s as mysterious as it is charming! This medium-sized wading bird is found on the Amami Islands of Japan and nowhere else in the world. Its brown, gray, and black feathers blend perfectly with the forest floor, making it nearly invisible to predators and curious humans. Its long, straight bill is like a secret weapon, perfect for digging into the soil to find worms, insects, and other underground treats.</p>
        <p>These birds grow about 33 to 38 centimeters (13 to 15 inches) long and have a plump, round body with short legs. But don’t be fooled by their stubby appearance—they’re excellent at staying hidden in the shadows of the forest. With their big, dark eyes placed high on their heads, they can spot danger from all angles, even at night.</p>
        <p>The <b>Amami Woodcock</b> is a night owl—it’s most active after the sun goes down. As darkness falls, it ventures out to feed, probing the ground with its sensitive bill, which can sense movement below the surface. It’s like having a built-in metal detector, but for finding dinner!</p>
        <p>When it’s time to raise a family, these clever birds build nests right on the ground, camouflaged among leaves and twigs. The female lays three to four eggs, and once they hatch, the chicks are quick learners. Within days, they’re already exploring the forest alongside their parents.</p>
        <p>Although the <b>Amami Woodcock</b>  isn’t officially endangered, it faces challenges like habitat loss and the introduction of predators like mongoose. Conservation efforts aim to protect its forest home, ensuring that this unique bird continues to thrive.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Unlike many birds, the Amami Woodcock doesn’t sing a lot. Instead, it communicates through subtle movements and quiet calls, staying as stealthy as a ninja!</p>
