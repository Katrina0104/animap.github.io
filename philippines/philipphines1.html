        <!--  Philippine Eagle -->
        <h2>1. Philippine Eagle</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Pithecophaga jefferyi</div>
        <img src="../philippines/philipphines animal img/Philippine Eagle.jpg" >
        <p>The Philippine Eagle is one of the most majestic and critically endangered birds in the world. Known as the "Monkey-eating Eagle," this powerful raptor is endemic to the Philippines, meaning it’s found nowhere else in the world. With a wingspan of up to 7.5 feet (2.3 meters), the Philippine Eagle is a true powerhouse of the skies, with sharp talons, a powerful beak, and strikingly beautiful feathers. Its crown of long, shaggy feathers gives it a unique, lion-like appearance that sets it apart from other eagles.</p>

        <p>Living in the dense forests of the Philippines, these eagles are at the top of the food chain, preying on monkeys, snakes, and other small to medium-sized animals. However, their habitats are increasingly threatened by deforestation, illegal hunting, and habitat loss, causing their numbers to dwindle. Conservation programs are in place to protect the eagle’s remaining habitats and prevent their extinction, but the fight for their survival is ongoing. Despite the challenges, the Philippine Eagle remains a symbol of strength and beauty, as well as a call to action for environmental conservation.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Philippine Eagle’s powerful beak is so strong that it can tear apart its prey, like monkeys, with ease!</p>

        <h2>2. Philippine Freshwater Crocodile </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Crocodylus mindorensis</div>
        <img src="../philippines/philipphines animal img/Philippine Freshwater Crocodile.jpg" >
        <p>The Philippine Freshwater Crocodile is one of the most endangered species of crocodile, and it is found only in the Philippines. This small to medium-sized crocodile typically inhabits freshwater lakes, rivers, and marshes, where it plays an important role in maintaining the balance of the ecosystem by controlling fish populations and eating dead or decaying animals. Unlike the saltwater crocodile, the Philippine Freshwater Crocodile is more elusive and has a less aggressive temperament toward humans, though it can still be dangerous if provoked.</p>

        <p>Historically, this species was more widespread, but overhunting for its skin, loss of habitat, and pollution have caused its population to plummet. Conservation efforts, including habitat restoration and captive breeding programs, are ongoing to protect this species, but it remains critically endangered. The Philippine Freshwater Crocodile is a key part of the country’s biodiversity and an important symbol in the fight for wildlife protection.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Philippine Freshwater Crocodiles are excellent swimmers and can hold their breath for up to 30 minutes underwater!</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Bubalus mindorensis</div>
        <img src="../philippines/philipphines animal img/Tamaraw.jpg" >
        <p>The Tamaraw is a critically endangered species of buffalo found only on the island of Mindoro in the Philippines. Smaller than its more well-known relative, the water buffalo, the Tamaraw is a stocky, muscular animal with short, dark fur and sharp, backward-curved horns. Despite being the national animal of the Philippines, the Tamaraw is rarely seen in the wild due to its shrinking population and habitat destruction caused by logging and agricultural activities.</p>

        <p>Tamaraws are herbivores, grazing on grasses and shrubs in the mountain slopes and forests of Mindoro. They are solitary or live in small groups and are known for their shyness. Efforts to protect the Tamaraw include preserving its natural habitats and implementing breeding programs in captivity. As one of the world's most endangered species, the Tamaraw serves as a symbol of the urgent need for conservation action in the Philippines.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Tamaraw is known for its strong, robust build, and its horns, which can grow up to 30 cm (12 inches) long, are quite impressive!</p>

        <!-- Walden's Hornbill -->

        <div class="taxonomy">Aceros waldeni</div>
        <img src="../philippines/philipphines animal img/Walden's Hornbill.jpg" >
        <p>Walden's Hornbill is a rare and beautiful bird found only in the forests of the Philippines. With its striking black and white plumage and large, colorful casque on its beak, the Walden's Hornbill is one of the most distinct and impressive hornbill species. These birds are arboreal, meaning they spend most of their time in the trees, where they forage for fruit, insects, and small animals. They are also known for their unique breeding habits, with females staying in tree cavities during the nesting season while males feed and protect them.</p>

        <p>Due to habitat loss, particularly from deforestation in their limited range, Walden's Hornbill is now critically endangered. This bird is a key indicator of forest health, as hornbills help to disperse seeds across large areas, promoting biodiversity. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting their habitats and raising awareness about the importance of hornbill species in maintaining forest ecosystems.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Walden's Hornbill is known for its unique nesting behavior, where the female seals herself in a tree cavity, and the male feeds her through a small opening until the chicks are ready to fledge!</p>
