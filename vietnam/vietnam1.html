        <!--  Saola -->
        <h2>1. Saola</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Pseudoryx nghetinhensis</div>
        <img src="../vietnam/vietnam animal img/Saola.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Saola</b>, also known as the "Asian Unicorn," is one of the rarest and most mysterious animals on Earth. Discovered in 1992 in the dense, mountainous forests of Vietnam and Laos, it’s so elusive that very few people have ever seen one! This incredible creature has a body that looks a bit like an antelope, but with features of a cow. Its coat is a rich chestnut brown with white markings on its face, making it stand out in the wild. The most striking feature of the Saola is its long, straight horns, which can grow up to 20 inches (50 cm) long in males! These horns help the Saola survive by defending itself and navigating the thick forests it calls home.</p>
        <p>The Saola lives high up in the mountains, where it’s hard to find. Because the forests are so dense and the Saola is so shy, it’s very difficult to study. These creatures are herbivores, meaning they eat plants like leaves, fruits, and grasses. They are most active in the cooler parts of the day, early in the morning and late in the afternoon. Despite their strength, Saolas are in big trouble. They are critically endangered, with fewer than 100 estimated to still be alive in the wild. The biggest threats to the Saola are hunting and the destruction of their natural home by people cutting down trees.</p>
        <p>To save the Saola, conservationists are working hard to protect the forests and keep these beautiful animals safe from hunters. Thanks to their hard work, there’s still hope for the Saola to survive, but they need all the help they can get!</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Saola is so rare and hard to spot that it’s often called a “living unicorn” because it’s as magical and mysterious as one!</p>

        <img src="../vietnam/vietnam animal img/javan rhinocheros.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Javan Rhinoceros</b> is one of the rarest animals on the planet, with fewer than 80 individuals left! Found only in one national park in Indonesia, the Ujung Kulon National Park, this rhinoceros is much smaller than its cousins, growing to about 10 feet long and 5 feet tall. Its thick, gray skin and single horn make it look like something straight out of the past! Unlike many other rhinos, the Javan Rhino is very shy and likes to stay hidden in the thick, swampy forests.</p>
        <p>These rhinos are herbivores, munching on grasses, fruits, and leaves to stay strong. Sadly, they are critically endangered, mainly due to poaching for their horns and the loss of their forest home. To protect these incredible creatures, conservationists are working hard to stop poaching and restore their forest habitat.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Javan Rhinos have one of the longest pregnancies in the animal kingdom, lasting a whopping 16 months!</p>

        <p>The <b>Red-shanked Douc Langur</b> is a colorful monkey that lives in the forests of Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia. Known for its striking red legs and face full of blues and whites, this monkey is one of the most beautiful primates you’ll ever see. It spends most of its time swinging through the trees, living in small groups with other monkeys. These monkeys are vegetarians, munching on leaves, fruits, and flowers in the forest canopy.</p>
        <p>Sadly, the Red-shanked Douc Langur is endangered because its forest home is being destroyed by people. These monkeys are also hunted for food and their beautiful fur. To protect them, conservationists are working to save the forests where they live and stop illegal hunting.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Red-shanked Douc Langur has a unique, loud call that echoes through the forests, helping it communicate with other monkeys!</p>

        <p><b>Delacour's Langur</b> is a striking monkey with black and white fur and a long, slender tail. Found only in the limestone forests of northern Vietnam, this endangered primate is famous for its beautiful appearance and incredible climbing skills. Delacour’s Langurs live in groups and spend most of their time in trees, hopping from branch to branch to stay safe from predators.</p>
        <p>These monkeys mostly eat leaves and flowers, using their strong jaws to break down tough plants. Sadly, their forest home is being destroyed, and they are hunted for their fur and body parts. Conservation efforts are underway to protect their remaining habitats and stop illegal hunting, but they need our help to survive!</p>
