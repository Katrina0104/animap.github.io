        <h2>1. Formosan Flying Fox</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Pteropus formosus</div>
        <img src="../taiwan/taiwan animal img/formosan flying fox.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Formosan Flying Fox</b> is a large fruit bat native to Taiwan, known for its impressive wingspan and unique appearance. With a wingspan that can reach up to 1.5 meters (5 feet), it is one of the largest bat species in the world. These bats are primarily nocturnal and are crucial pollinators and seed dispersers in the forests of Taiwan. Their large ears and fluffy fur make them easily recognizable. They primarily feed on fruits, especially figs, and their role in the ecosystem is vital for the regeneration of many plant species.</p>
        <p><b>Formosan Flying Foxes</b> are social animals, roosting in large colonies during the day and flying out at night to forage. While they are not aggressive, they do have sharp teeth and claws, which they use to grab onto fruit and to navigate through the trees. They play an important role in keeping the forests healthy by spreading seeds and pollens. However, due to habitat loss and hunting pressures, their numbers have been declining in recent years, making them a species of concern for conservationists.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Despite being called "flying foxes," these creatures are not foxes! They are fruit bats, and their name comes from the shape of their face, which resembles that of a fox.</p>

        <div class="taxonomy"> Hynobius formosanus</div>
        <img src="../taiwan/taiwan animal img/formosan salamander.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Formosan Salamander</b> is a unique and fascinating amphibian species found exclusively on the island of Taiwan. Known for its striking appearance and elusive nature, the Formosan Salamander is one of the largest salamander species in the world. It has a long, sleek body that can grow up to 25 cm (10 inches) and is often characterized by its dark coloration, which helps it blend into the rocky, moist environments it inhabits. These salamanders are nocturnal and prefer cool, humid environments, making them elusive and rarely seen.</p>

        <p><b>Formosan Salamanders</b> are found in a variety of habitats across Taiwan, including mountain streams, caves, and forests. They are carnivores, preying on small invertebrates, insects, and amphibians. Their diet helps to control the populations of these species in their native habitats. As they grow, they undergo a metamorphosis, transitioning from an aquatic larval stage to a fully terrestrial adult. While not much is known about their breeding habits, it is believed that they lay their eggs in moist, secluded areas where the larvae can thrive in the cool, moist conditions.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> These salamanders can live for many years, and their slow movement and secretive nature have led to them being known as "living fossils" in some parts of Taiwan.</p>

        <p>The <b>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin</b> is closely related to its Pacific counterpart and shares many of the same behaviors and physical traits. This species is found in the warm coastal waters of the Indo-Pacific region, where it plays a significant role in the local ecosystem. With a slightly smaller size compared to the Pacific Bottlenose Dolphin, these dolphins are still highly social and often found in large pods, which can consist of dozens of individuals.</p>

        <p><b>Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins</b> are known for their playful and curious nature. They have a diverse diet, feeding on fish, crustaceans, and squid. They are also skilled hunters, often using cooperation and echolocation to capture prey. Their communication abilities are advanced, and they use a range of clicks, whistles, and body language to interact with other dolphins and coordinate group activities. This species is also known to engage in social bonding behaviors, such as rubbing and playing with each other.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Indo-Pacific Bottlenose Dolphins are frequently seen riding the wake of boats and interacting with humans, showing their friendly nature!</p>
