        <!--  Egyptian Vulture -->
        <h2>5. Egyptian Vulture</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy"> Neophron percnopterus</div>
        <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/egyptian vulture.jpeg" >
        <p>The <b>Egyptian Vulture</b> is a fascinating bird of prey known for its unique appearance and important ecological role as a scavenger. With its white feathers, yellow face, and distinctively long, curved beak, this vulture stands out in the skies of Africa, Europe, and parts of Asia. Unlike many other vultures, the Egyptian Vulture is smaller and often considered one of the most intelligent among vultures. It is known to use tools, such as picking up rocks to break open the eggs of larger birds, a remarkable skill not often seen in the animal kingdom. This vulture primarily feeds on carrion, but it also enjoys a diet of eggs, small animals, and even garbage, making it a vital part of the ecosystem by helping to clean up carcasses and maintain a healthy environment.</p>

        <p>Egyptian Vultures migrate across vast distances, traveling from their breeding grounds in southern Europe and Central Asia to Africa during the winter months. They are solitary or found in small groups, and their keen eyesight helps them locate food from great distances. However, they are facing several threats, including habitat loss, poisoning, and human persecution. Conservation efforts are focused on protecting nesting sites, reducing poisoning incidents, and ensuring safe migratory routes.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> The Egyptian Vulture is often referred to as a "tool user" because it has been observed using rocks to break open the eggs of larger birdsâ€”just like some primates!</p>

        <!-- Goitered Gazelle -->
        <h2>6. Goitered Gazelle</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Gazella subgutturosa</div>
        <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/goitered gazelle.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Goitered Gazelle</b>, also known as the Black-tailed Gazelle, is a graceful and agile animal native to the arid regions of Central Asia. Known for its slender body, sharp horns, and distinctive goiter (a swelling in its throat), this gazelle is a true survivor in harsh desert landscapes. Its goiter, a unique adaptation, helps the gazelle regulate its temperature and conserve water, which is essential in its dry, hot habitat. The Goitered Gazelle is often found in open grasslands, semi-deserts, and rocky slopes, where it can use its speed and agility to escape predators like wolves and jackals. These gazelles are herd animals, often found in small groups, and they rely on their keen sense of hearing and sight to detect danger from afar.</p>

        <p>Despite their ability to thrive in challenging environments, Goitered Gazelles face significant threats due to hunting, habitat loss, and competition with livestock. Their population has dramatically decreased in some areas, and conservation efforts are focused on habitat restoration, protection from poaching, and increasing awareness of their role in the ecosystem.</p>

        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Goitered Gazelles have a unique "goiter" under their throat, which helps them survive in dry, hot climates by conserving water and regulating their body temperature!</p>

       <!-- Wild Bactrian Camel -->
       <h2>7. Wild Bactrian Camel </h2>
       <div class="taxonomy">Camelus ferus</div>
       <img src="../mongolia/mongolia animal img/Wild Bactrian Camel.JPG" >
       <p>The <b>Wild Bactrian Camel</b> is one of the toughest animals in the world, living in the deserts of China and Mongolia. This remarkable camel has long, shaggy hair and two distinct humps that are perfectly adapted to life in the extreme desert climate. The Wild Bactrian Camel is built for survival in conditions where most other animals would struggle. It can go without drinking fresh water for days, weeks, or even longer, relying on salty water from lakes and moisture from the plants it eats. This camel has a high tolerance for salt, which allows it to thrive in areas where other animals would dehydrate. Unlike domesticated camels, which can be found across the world, the Wild Bactrian Camel is a wild creature, living in the most remote, harshest parts of the desert.</p>
       <p>Sadly, these extraordinary animals are facing serious threats. Their habitat is disappearing due to human activity, including overgrazing by livestock and climate change. The Wild Bactrian Camel is now critically endangered, with only a small population remaining in the wild. Conservationists are working to protect these desert survivors, but much work remains to be done to ensure they do not vanish forever.</p>
       <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Did you know the Wild Bactrian Camel can survive without drinking fresh water? It gets all the moisture it needs from salty lakes and desert plants!</p>
