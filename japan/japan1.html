        <h2>1. Amami Rabbit</h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Pentalagus furnessi</div>
        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/images.jpg" >
        <p>The <b>Amami Rabbit</b> is a rare and endangered species found only on the Amami Islands of Japan. This special rabbit is one of Japan's most endangered mammals and is protected as a national treasure. With its stout build, this rabbit grows about 40 to 50 centimeters (16 to 20 inches) long and weighs around 2 to 2.5 kilograms (4.4 to 5.5 pounds). Its fur is thick and soft, keeping it warm in the subtropical climate. The rabbit has dark brown or black fur on its back, with lighter, reddish-brown fur underneath. Its small, round eyes and short ears help it blend into its dense forest habitat.</p>
        <p>The <b>Amami Rabbit</b> is most active at dawn and dusk, and it prefers to stay alone, making it quite shy and hard to spot in the wild. Its diet mainly consists of plants, like leaves, grasses, and bark. One cool thing about this rabbit is that it can eat plants that are toxic to other animals! </p>
        <p> Sadly, the Amami Rabbit is critically endangered due to habitat loss, invasive predators like cats and mongoose, and climate change. But efforts are being made to protect this precious animal, including creating safe places for them to live and breeding programs to help their population grow.</p>
        <p> <b>Fun Fact:</b>  The Amami Rabbit is considered a "living fossil" because it has remained relatively unchanged for millions of years!</p>

        <div class="taxonomy">Prionailurus bengalensis iriomotensis</div>
        <img src="../japan/japan animal img/Iriomote.webp" >
        <p>The <b>Iriomote Cat</b> is a tiny wild cat that lives only on the island of Iriomote in Japan. It’s a special subspecies of the leopard cat and is one of the rarest cats in the world, with fewer than 100 individuals left! This cat is small and agile, weighing around 2 to 3 kilograms (4.4 to 6.6 pounds) and measuring 60 to 70 centimeters (24 to 28 inches) long. It has a beautiful coat of reddish-brown or yellow-brown fur with dark spots, which helps it hide in the forest.</p>
        <p>The <b>Iriomote Cat</b> is a night-time hunter, mostly sneaking around in the dark to find its food. It’s a great climber and swimmer, which helps it catch prey like small mammals, birds, and insects. Even though it’s shy, it’s a skilled predator and has a unique way of marking its territory.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the Iriomote Cat is also critically endangered due to habitat loss, introduced predators, and human activities. However, there are ongoing conservation efforts to help save this rare cat, such as protecting its habitat, restoring forests, and educating people about its plight.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> This rare cat is one of the few felines that regularly swims in the wild!</p>

        <!-- Okinawa Rail -->
        <h2>3. Okinawa Rail </h2>
        <div class="taxonomy">Gallirallus okinawae</div>

        <p>The <b>Okinawa Rail</b> is a mysterious and endangered bird found only on the island of Okinawa in Japan. This unique, flightless bird measures about 33 to 38 centimeters (13 to 15 inches) and has dark brown or black feathers, which help it stay hidden in the dense forests it calls home. Its small wings and short tail make it a terrible flier, but that’s no problem because it’s such an excellent runner! This bird has bright reddish-brown eyes and a slender bill, giving it a striking look. It spends most of its time on the ground, hidden under thick bushes, searching for food like insects, snails, and worms.</p>
        <p>The <b>Okinawa Rail</b> is most active during the day, but since it likes to stay out of sight, it’s hard to spot. Sadly, the Okinawa Rail is critically endangered. The biggest threats it faces are habitat destruction and the introduction of predators like mongooses and snakes. People are working hard to save the Okinawa Rail by protecting its home in forests and making sure harmful animals can’t invade. The efforts include creating safe areas, doing research, and raising awareness about this special bird.</p>
        <p><b>Fun Fact:</b> Okinawa Rails are so shy and secretive that they’re often called “ghost birds”—they’re almost impossible to spot in the wild!</p>
